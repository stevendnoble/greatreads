# Word Wizz&#601;rd
What better way is there to practice English language skills than through games?  Word Wizz&#601;rd helps you practice parts of speech and spelling, while having fun and competing for a top spot in the leaderboard.

There are currently three games in Word Wizz&#601;rd:

* Inject-a-Word:  fill in the story with words using the parts of speech
* Unscramble-a-Word:  unscramble words using context clues
* Proofread-a-Story:  find the misspelled words

## Technologies Used

* NodeJS
* ExpressJS
* MongoDB (with Mongoose)
* AngularJS
* HTML (with Bootstrap)
* CSS for custom styling
* JavaScript for custom functions

## Installation Steps
To install this application on your own machine, simply clone the repository, run npm install, and open up http://localhost:3000 in your browser.

## Planned Features

In the future, I plan to add:

* Additional games
* Validations on the form submissions
* Change flow of the score saving
* Features to make the app more responsive
